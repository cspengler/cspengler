### Hello there! :wave:
:us:/:canada:/:chile:

I'm an astronomy postdoctoral fellow currently based in Victoria, Canada. I use ultraviolet, visible, and infrared imaging data â€” and sometimes spectroscopy â€” to study nearby galaxies. Specifically, I am interested in how the compact, dense objects at the centers of galaxies (manifesting as nuclear star clusters and/or supermassive black holes) came to be, as well as how they influence and are influenced by their host galaxies and other factors.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on using clustering algorithms to identify different galaxy groups and environments
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use github (better late than never!)
